            <br/> <br/>

            <p><em>Louise von Salomé</em> was born in St. Petersburg, Russia, on February 12, 1861, the sixth child of
                the family and the first girl. Lou grew up in a harmonious home where he learned to love and understand.
                His father, General Gustav von Salomé, was an officer of the Russian Tsar. Extremely affectionate, he
                exercised paternal authority with love. Capable of small manifestations of tenderness, such as coming
                back from the receptions promoted by the Tsar bringing bonbons to the children. Lou regarded the father
                as the "first model of God."</p>
            <p>The mother, Mrs. Louise Wilm von Salomé, was a sweet, deeply religious person dedicated to the family,
                with a great capacity for resolution and independent temperament. Parents loved each other and mutual
                respect prevailed. When the daughter was born, the general thought it natural to put the name of the
                wife, the "most beautiful name in the world." Considered rebellious and willful, she often clashed with
                her mother's authority, a situation that lasted throughout her life.With the intellectual effervescence
                that he lived and his deep admiration for philosophy, he launched his first book at the beginning of the
                century, called In the Fight for God.</p>
            <p>Shortly thereafter, he showed his great admiration for his friend Nietzsche, publishing his second book:
                Friedrich Nietzsche and his work.
                Lou Andreas Salome was a pioneer woman, both in the intellectual and behavioral aspects, and essential
                in the lives of some of the most important thinkers of all time. But despite his intelligence and his
                work, fame and legacy were inherited only by the male names with whom he became involved. Lou passed
                away at age 76 on February 5, 1937, and in addition to inspiring some of the most important men in the
                world, was above all a free, independent woman, a great intellectual and feminine icon of the twentieth
                century.</p>
